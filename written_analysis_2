New Vehicle Additions:

Upon the introduction of a novel vehicle into the fleet, a data entry is duly incorporated into the Vehicles table. 
At the onset, there shall be an absence of any corresponding rental agreement within the Rental_Agreements table due to the vehicle's non-utilization in rental operations. 
The one-to-one relationship mechanism assures that each vehicle is eligible for association with a maximum of one rental agreement,
thereby forestalling any potential discord with extant rental arrangements.

Rental Agreement Updates:

In the event of a vehicle being engaged for rental purposes, the initiation of a fresh rental agreement entry transpires within the Rental_Agreements table, 
anchored by the vehicle's designated vehicle_id. Should there arise a necessity for the revision of the rental agreement terms,
be it an adjustment in the rental tariff or an extension of the rental duration, the corresponding data entry in the Rental_Agreements table stands 

amenable to subsequent modifications. The one-to-one relational model guarantees that each vehicle is exclusively affiliated with a singular rental agreement, 
thereby obviating any ambiguity or contentions arising from the simultaneous existence of multiple rental agreements for a particular vehicle.

Vehicle Availability Checks:

In order to ascertain the availability status of a vehicle, the system executes a targeted query within the Rental_Agreements table, 
specifically aimed at the stipulated vehicle_id. In the absence of a rental agreement associated with the vehicle—manifested by a NULL 
value for the vehicle_id in Rental_Agreements—the vehicle is deemed available for rental. Conversely, the presence of an extant rental
agreement for the vehicle serves as an indicator of its current occupancy status, rendering the vehicle unavailable for rental.

Returning Rented Vehicles:

Upon the conclusion of a rental period, the restoration of a rented vehicle prompts the subsequent updating
or deletion of the corresponding rental agreement entry within the Rental_Agreements table, contingent upon 
predefined operational protocols. In the event of the deletion of the rental agreement entry, the vehicle is 
reinstated to an available state for rental, accompanied by requisite adjustments to the rental history records.
